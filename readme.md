## How the game looks like right now

![Printscreen from the game](/assets/game_printscreen.png "Printscreen from the game")

## What I have so far

- Character movement and 1 simple attack
- 1 automatic spell
- Damage system
- 2 different monsters and 1 pacific mob
- Enemy spawn and waves system
- Mob drops
- UI with elapsed time and gold counter
- Game over and automatic restart

## Things I want to implement

### UI

- On Game Over screen:
	- Show restart cooldown
	- Add button to restart immediately
	- Add button to go to main menu
- Add a main menu
- Add fullscreen mode
- Display enemies life

### Gameplay
- Create leveling/upgrade system
- Add more spells
- Add more enemies
